## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Arkansas, working with [Dr. Ngan Le](https://uark-aicv.github.io/team/ngan_le). My research focuses on exploring visual perception and its connection to language, 3D vision, and robotic manipulation.

I earned my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Arkansas in 2024, supervised by Dr. Ngan Le. Prior to that, I completed my MSc and BSc in Computer Science at Ho Chi Minh University of Science, Vietnam.
