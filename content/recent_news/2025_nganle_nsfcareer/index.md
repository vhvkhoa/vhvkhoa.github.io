My Ph.D. and postdoc advisor, Dr. Ngan Le, has secured a [2025 NSF CAREER Award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2443877&HistoricalAwards=false).

## Summary
The five‑year project, *“Trustworthy, Robust, and Efficient Multimodal Framework for Video Analytics”*, will focus on exploring ways to fuse vision, language, audio, IMU signals to build a generalist Video-Language Model (VLM) that stays robust under noise, and explains its decisions on various video analysis tasks, e.g., action recognition, video retrieval, captioning, visual question answering.

## My contribution
With the guidance of Dr. Ngan Le, I co‑developed the research vision, drafted technical sections, and incorporate proof‑of‑concept publications that strengthened the proposal. These efforts were instrumental in crafting a compelling narrative that helped win this milestone grant for the AICV Lab.
